My first visit for the lunch meal/thali/sadya was on Thiru Onam (September, 2019). I thought the meal was just special on that day.  Today, I went again. Once again, the sadya was simply special---that too, with four payasams! Apart from that, 4 pickles, 4 curd-based curries, 4 vegetable dishes, banana-chips-n-jaggery savoury, papad, banana, choice of white or chamba rice, parippu/dal with as much ghee you want, sambhar, buttermilk, moru and rasam. All unlimited, even payasam. Have I missed anything?  But, what stood out today is the service. Do you know another place (packed with people) where the owner attends to customers? He even brought a basket of papads for us when he saw that one of us enjoyed papad with payasam. We did not even ask for it. His employees/colleagues seemed to share the same enthusiasm, right down to the person assisting at the car park in front. They were that attentive. They brought extra bananas, served with a smile, even had time to joke with us, made sure we enjoyed a Kerala sadya the way it should be enjoyed. I have never felt so satisfied at a place.
It was interesting to be there with my guests for a Kerala Style Sadya... On a plantain leaf, it was served with a range of dishes and 4 different varieties of payasam( a typical kerala sweet dessert, in a rather liquid form) The other curries and the quality of serving did not match the style and grandeur of the meal, still it was a great experience. The suppliers were taking short cut to serve above the plate of the guy sitting next to you, rather than coming to your side and serving in proper manner.
One of the best place in Kerala to have variety of dosa. Nice place for comfortable family dining, in budget way
Super vegetarian restaurant. Everyday kerala traditional feast is served. So many dishes with payasam
Overall good experience,parking space available good hygiene and air condition hall..variety of dosa also available other than their Sadhya which I liked most must visit with when in trivendram
The lunch menu which resembles the traditional onam sadhya of kerala is their main attraction. Such is the taste, that you will bee prompted to order more.
Schezwan Dosa, that too 3 in number I had. One hell of a dosa it was. Their dosa varieties are very famous I think. Person nearby my seat was also ordering some variety of dosa from their menu.
I am heavily amazed by the varieties, Schezwan, mysore masala dosa, I had these two and the taste is simply spell binding. All were in awe of the lunch, but am in awe of the dosas here.
We went for dinner and as soon as we entered we realised that it was a huge mistake to come. Place was overcrowded to say the least. Limited food options and weird looking drink being served to all the customers. We were so put off that we didn’t order and left.
Mothers Vedge is the best place to get sadhia. Served on a banana leave with outstanding quality. On sadhia is 180 INR and it’s worth it.

Great food and great staff. Delicious. Easily reachable by auto. Had a great time. Payasams are great
How can they serve such sadya(Meals in Malayalam) all the days, that too these many cuisines. 4 type of kheers? Heavenly experience. Please do visit.
365 days a year lunch, 4 paayasam, immensely tasty cusines. Ho, my mouth is full of water now. Must must go to place.
Had a evening tea/dinner there... Dosas and puri were good.. tried uthappam which was not good... was able to find park right in front of hotel... There was a little bit of wait time for someo e to take the orders but after that it was all smooth...
Been to this restaurant for a couple of times to indulge in some delicious vegetarian food. Different types of dosas are the main speciality. To add on to that, a special emotion to the Sadhya available on all the 365 calendar days and it’s just for ₹180, which I believe is quite reasonable for the quantity of the food. My personal favorite dosas are Podi Dosa, Cheese Dosa and Jini Dosa.
We placed order for two Onam Sadhya. Full Payment of close to Rs. 900 per person [yes you read it right. It was a total of whooping Rs. 1800 for 2 packs] was collected earlier itself[when we tool the coupons]. My dad went to collect the Sadhya by 11:30 AM since we were told while collecting the coupons that the Sadhya would be ready by then. There were close to 100 people already in the queue by then.  Within 30 mins, the queue grew to more than 200, I believe. They did not have the food / parcels ready by then. All the people who were supposed to pack food was busy serving Sadhya to the people inside. As per my understanding, since the money for parcel was already collected[two days in advance], they were concentrating on the live Sadhya serving since it would be the current profit which they would be getting.  I had been to this hotel earlier and had faced delays but not like this. This time, we ended up getting the boxes by 1:30 PM. This is not any exaggeration. Again, the rice was under cooked and there were 5 Payasams. 1 payasam[parippu] was good but for the remaining 3, it was more of same Jaggery water mixed with different boiled things like, ada, wheat etc. and 1 paal payasam was too watery.  When they received the coupon order earlier itself, they should have packed and kept everything ready based on the coupons sold. I am not at all a fan of wasting food, but this was the limit. I really hated the way these guys handled the demand. It was horrible experience especially considering the fact that they were exploiting the demand in the market!!  Issues with Onam Sadhya 2019: - Exorbitantly Expensive - Poor Quality - Poor Management
Had booked food parcel for 15 people on the Thiruvonam day (11th September) . Paid the full amount on the 10th evening and was assured that the food would be ready for collection at 12 pm in time for lunch . Arrived at restaurant at 12 and found a queue of over 200 people waiting . The food parcels were not ready and very few members of staff to deliver the parcels . Had to stand in the queue for over 2.5 hrs to get the Sadya parcel . Unfortunately couldn’t leave and ask for refund as there were limited options to get the meal on Thiruvonam day in trivandrum for 15 people . There was limited communication from the restaurant staff except saying that food would arrive - arrive it did in trickles resulting in severe delays . The restaurant should not have taken orders if it could not deliver . At the very least they could have allocated adequate staff to man the counter and deliver the parcels . I witnessed heated arguments between customers who were frustrated at standing for long hours . Thankfully there were no scuffles although there was a lot of jostling. I was surprised to witness the level of hygiene or rather lack of it . Torn sacks of vegetables were left outside ( often trampled by the customers waiting in the queue) with overflowing bins of waste food accumulating near the delivery counter . Water was seeping through and mixing with the vegetables on the sacks . The quality of the food was very poor - rice was undercooked and the curry’s were at best average . The payasams were below par . I am surprised to see the positive reviews (this is my first experience- and definitely the last ) . If this is an aberration or a one off ( I would be surprised looking at the attitude of the staff and unhygienic environment) then management needs to pull up it socks as in this day and age Customers deserve better !
Food tastes good, is traditional and comes on a banana leave. But they want you to come, eat as fast as possible and go out. Not relaxing. Also to be honest the food is a lot. They love to explain to white people what the health benefits are. Well, they give serveral over-sweetend desserts. Some are liquid and you should drink them out of your hand. But give it a try, it's a good experience and vegetarian.
A very good place for veg food in Thiruvanathapuram. Good varieties of dosas in the evening and tasty breakfast options. Service is a bit slow in the morning and also the tea they serve is not the best. They have year round sadhya meals which is very good. Rest all a good spacious restaurant. Parking could become an issue during rush hours.
Quite ok to eat at the restaurant but over crowded. NEVER order online bcoz they miss out many items and charge much more.......this is definitely intentional as it has happened to me thrice.

Delicious food for reasonable price. Sandhya on all days and very delicious. Main attractive is it's only vegetarian.
Its a must try for guys who visit tvm.fof locals it's just a sadhya we eat on one or any occasion or any hindu wedding ...but non malayalees must try it especially with 4 payasam . This style sadhya you will never get except tvm.go for it rather than taste of money it's the experience.....
Me and my girlfriend visited them and then kept coming back for the next two days. We ordered a Sadhya and some dosas for the first time, not only the food was amazing, but the staff ended us explaining the ingredients and how to correctly eat them. The results was that we ended up overeating not once but several times in the next couple of days!! I highly recommend.
No words ,after a great meal had to crawl out and had wonderful sleep. Felt like an annaconda. Enjoy take sadhya only.
Good place for a properly laid traditional kerala sadya meals. Vegetarian. Served on banana leaves. Well done flavours and spices.. busy and may need to wait in a queue. No reservations. Not a great ambience but fairly priced. Place to experience a nice sadya for nostalgia or to try once if not had one before.
Got feedback from many of my friends who had visited this place when they are in trivandrum and find to be one of the worthy choice, simple and economical. Recommended to those who want to have a vegetarian treat in trivandrum
Visited this restaurant with my family tried 3 varieties of dosa. taste was ok but they are using lot of oil
An authentic place for Kerala vegetarian Lunch, lavish varieties with 4 types of Payasam. Tasting varieties Payasam with Banana, poppadam, Boli makes more tastier. A must place for everyday lunch. for dinner try varieties of mouth watering Dosas. I visit for lunch and dinner everyday during my stay. regards, Sundaresh
Liked this place good vegetarian food is being served here and ambience is also quite well. Sadhya is the speciality.
We reached Mothers Veg Plaza around 04:00 pm for lunch. Kerala Sadhaya was available even at that time and few of us opted for that and rest went for dosa items. The spread for Kerala Sadhya was huge and all dishes were very tasty - especially all of us loved the the fresh mango pickle. The service of waitress Ms. Thanki was unbelievable - she was literally feeding / pampering us as a sister or even a mother would do at home. We haven't seen service of this quality anywhere. She was insisting us to taste all four payasams of which the wheat payasam was really good.  Great restaurant with great service and excellent food.

It was really amazing experience. If any one visit Kerala I personally recommend to visit this place to have Kerala food.
If want to try out original authentic kerala food and you are in Trivandrum then this is the best place to crash in. I never had such super veg items before. I ate like mad, my stomach got full but heart was asking for more.
Just visited the venue and the service is great. The food was the BEST I have eaten in a long time. There were 6 times of chutney and pickle. Kerala and regular rice. 2types of Daal, 4types of veggies, papad, banana, kerala chips, etc etc. Cost 180Rs. For unlimited fresh sumptuous food. Def going to visit again ASAP.
We had gone to the restaurant to have the authentic Kerala Sadya, but unfortunately, it is not served at dinner time. So we tried the 7* uttapam and a plate of variety dosa. The food was tasty and flavorful. The variety dosa plate had about 5 mini dosas. There is a wide and different variety of dosas on the menu like pizza dosa, Mexican dosa, pasta dosa, Chinese dosa.
We had breakfast form here. Ordered special dosa, dry fruit dosa and jini dosa. All were tasty and lot of quantity.
Its the best restaurant in the city you can afford, if you are a veg lover, especially the traditional sadya, mmmmm its yummy ...
Oh dear Gods what is this magical place? Were the first thoughts that came to my mind as I started to try the many selections of dosa we had ordered. I was here with my husband's family who are locals and I proceeded to astound them and myself with the amount of food I consumed. This was hands down the best dosa I have ever had! We finished with pineapple pudding & I went into a food coma. The service was also impeccable. Sorry, I forgot to take pictures of out food before I devoured it but here is our lovely family instead .
No doubt, if you wanted to try a tasty and stupendous Kerala traditional sadhya served on Banana leaf, just visit this place. The quality of food is indeed good, and the service is much superior. They will help you how to try the Sadhya in traditional way. The payasams in the end makes it a perfect climax. When you consider the quality of food and service the cost is too low. This is located again in the heart of the city. Yes, i major precaution you should take before visiting the restaurant is "KINDLY STARVE FOR OVERNIGHT AND GO"
Really good food, enjoyed the meals at noon time. The place is always busy and the owner and staff are very attentive to your needs.
if you are a sadhya monger this is the place to be. you will get traditional kerala sadhyas with aviyal,thoran,olan, kichadies,pickles,paruppu,sambar,rasam butter milk and 4 varrities of payasam ,with boli and bananas .. walk in and relish tummy full of yummy kerala sadhya.
My first visit for the lunch meal/thali/sadya was on Thiru Onam (September, 2019). I thought the meal was just special on that day.  Today, I went again. Once again, the sadya was simply special---that too, with four payasams! Apart from that, 4 pickles, 4 curd-based curries, 4 vegetable dishes, banana-chips-n-jaggery savoury, papad, banana, choice of white or chamba rice, parippu/dal with as much ghee you want, sambhar, buttermilk, moru and rasam. All unlimited, even payasam. Have I missed anything?  But, what stood out today is the service. Do you know another place (packed with people) where the owner attends to customers? He even brought a basket of papads for us when he saw that one of us enjoyed papad with payasam. We did not even ask for it. His employees/colleagues seemed to share the same enthusiasm, right down to the person assisting at the car park in front. They were that attentive. They brought extra bananas, served with a smile, even had time to joke with us, made sure we enjoyed a Kerala sadya the way it should be enjoyed. I have never felt so satisfied at a place.
It was interesting to be there with my guests for a Kerala Style Sadya... On a plantain leaf, it was served with a range of dishes and 4 different varieties of payasam( a typical kerala sweet dessert, in a rather liquid form) The other curries and the quality of serving did not match the style and grandeur of the meal, still it was a great experience. The suppliers were taking short cut to serve above the plate of the guy sitting next to you, rather than coming to your side and serving in proper manner.
One of the best place in Kerala to have variety of dosa. Nice place for comfortable family dining, in budget way
Super vegetarian restaurant. Everyday kerala traditional feast is served. So many dishes with payasam
Overall good experience,parking space available good hygiene and air condition hall..variety of dosa also available other than their Sadhya which I liked most must visit with when in trivendram
The lunch menu which resembles the traditional onam sadhya of kerala is their main attraction. Such is the taste, that you will bee prompted to order more.
Schezwan Dosa, that too 3 in number I had. One hell of a dosa it was. Their dosa varieties are very famous I think. Person nearby my seat was also ordering some variety of dosa from their menu.
I am heavily amazed by the varieties, Schezwan, mysore masala dosa, I had these two and the taste is simply spell binding. All were in awe of the lunch, but am in awe of the dosas here.
We went for dinner and as soon as we entered we realised that it was a huge mistake to come. Place was overcrowded to say the least. Limited food options and weird looking drink being served to all the customers. We were so put off that we didn’t order and left.
Mothers Vedge is the best place to get sadhia. Served on a banana leave with outstanding quality. On sadhia is 180 INR and it’s worth it.
Great food and great staff. Delicious. Easily reachable by auto. Had a great time. Payasams are great
How can they serve such sadya(Meals in Malayalam) all the days, that too these many cuisines. 4 type of kheers? Heavenly experience. Please do visit.
365 days a year lunch, 4 paayasam, immensely tasty cusines. Ho, my mouth is full of water now. Must must go to place.
Had a evening tea/dinner there... Dosas and puri were good.. tried uthappam which was not good... was able to find park right in front of hotel... There was a little bit of wait time for someo e to take the orders but after that it was all smooth...
Been to this restaurant for a couple of times to indulge in some delicious vegetarian food. Different types of dosas are the main speciality. To add on to that, a special emotion to the Sadhya available on all the 365 calendar days and it’s just for ₹180, which I believe is quite reasonable for the quantity of the food. My personal favorite dosas are Podi Dosa, Cheese Dosa and Jini Dosa.
We placed order for two Onam Sadhya. Full Payment of close to Rs. 900 per person [yes you read it right. It was a total of whooping Rs. 1800 for 2 packs] was collected earlier itself[when we tool the coupons]. My dad went to collect the Sadhya by 11:30 AM since we were told while collecting the coupons that the Sadhya would be ready by then. There were close to 100 people already in the queue by then.  Within 30 mins, the queue grew to more than 200, I believe. They did not have the food / parcels ready by then. All the people who were supposed to pack food was busy serving Sadhya to the people inside. As per my understanding, since the money for parcel was already collected[two days in advance], they were concentrating on the live Sadhya serving since it would be the current profit which they would be getting.  I had been to this hotel earlier and had faced delays but not like this. This time, we ended up getting the boxes by 1:30 PM. This is not any exaggeration. Again, the rice was under cooked and there were 5 Payasams. 1 payasam[parippu] was good but for the remaining 3, it was more of same Jaggery water mixed with different boiled things like, ada, wheat etc. and 1 paal payasam was too watery.  When they received the coupon order earlier itself, they should have packed and kept everything ready based on the coupons sold. I am not at all a fan of wasting food, but this was the limit. I really hated the way these guys handled the demand. It was horrible experience especially considering the fact that they were exploiting the demand in the market!!  Issues with Onam Sadhya 2019: - Exorbitantly Expensive - Poor Quality - Poor Management
Had booked food parcel for 15 people on the Thiruvonam day (11th September) . Paid the full amount on the 10th evening and was assured that the food would be ready for collection at 12 pm in time for lunch . Arrived at restaurant at 12 and found a queue of over 200 people waiting . The food parcels were not ready and very few members of staff to deliver the parcels . Had to stand in the queue for over 2.5 hrs to get the Sadya parcel . Unfortunately couldn’t leave and ask for refund as there were limited options to get the meal on Thiruvonam day in trivandrum for 15 people . There was limited communication from the restaurant staff except saying that food would arrive - arrive it did in trickles resulting in severe delays . The restaurant should not have taken orders if it could not deliver . At the very least they could have allocated adequate staff to man the counter and deliver the parcels . I witnessed heated arguments between customers who were frustrated at standing for long hours . Thankfully there were no scuffles although there was a lot of jostling. I was surprised to witness the level of hygiene or rather lack of it . Torn sacks of vegetables were left outside ( often trampled by the customers waiting in the queue) with overflowing bins of waste food accumulating near the delivery counter . Water was seeping through and mixing with the vegetables on the sacks . The quality of the food was very poor - rice was undercooked and the curry’s were at best average . The payasams were below par . I am surprised to see the positive reviews (this is my first experience- and definitely the last ) . If this is an aberration or a one off ( I would be surprised looking at the attitude of the staff and unhygienic environment) then management needs to pull up it socks as in this day and age Customers deserve better !
Food tastes good, is traditional and comes on a banana leave. But they want you to come, eat as fast as possible and go out. Not relaxing. Also to be honest the food is a lot. They love to explain to white people what the health benefits are. Well, they give serveral over-sweetend desserts. Some are liquid and you should drink them out of your hand. But give it a try, it's a good experience and vegetarian.
A very good place for veg food in Thiruvanathapuram. Good varieties of dosas in the evening and tasty breakfast options. Service is a bit slow in the morning and also the tea they serve is not the best. They have year round sadhya meals which is very good. Rest all a good spacious restaurant. Parking could become an issue during rush hours.

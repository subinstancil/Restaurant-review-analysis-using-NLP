 Good,was delicious and a great value. The curries are of different taste than we get on other restaurants in Trivandrum. I give two rating for cleanliness. It is better to take parcel and have at home.
Its not pure gujarathi food.Just poori with curries.So if you don't have much expectation and just want to have poori n curry with papad its good. Some of my
If you want to taste the best poori in town with a variety of Curries, you must go to this small hotel near Parthas, Trivandrum. The price is cheap and the food is tasty. Good service too. Don't expect ultra cleanliness.
If you are a foodie a must visit . If you want style don't go . Unique nice food with a unique taste and great value for money . Open only 3 pm to 8 pm
Saurashtra hotel locally called Saurashtra Bhavan is the and very few place where we get good Gujarati food.They serve typical Gujarati meals for lunch and Gujarathi poori from evening. Chilly pickle they serve with poori is soo yummy.Rate also reasonable ,Only problem is the car parking,
This restaurant bis known for its pooris( their only item I believe. I have also heard they have chapatis in afternoon, but I am not sure). They serve it four curries and a pickle. No fuss restaurant. A small place, but that is enough. Their pooris are fairly priced also. Each plate contains papd also. Their tea is also unique. A must try in Trivandrum
A very old eating place which serves only poori in the traditional Gujarati/ Saurashtrian style and flavour. Operates from 3:00 pm onwards till around 8:30 pm. Serves only pooru and masala tea. The taste has been consistent over the years. A budget eatery
Its a no fuzz place., teeming with people all the time.They serve only Poori, but my god, they are amazing.
If you are looking for low budget, tasty food and you are ok with waiting for 10mins outside the restaurant for seat. Cleanliness is an issue.
Don't miss this old small Hotel when in Trivandrum city. This gujarathi Hotel started 50 years back now known as Sourashtra POORI Kada is a very different small Hotel, of its kind. It is located in a bylane next to Parthas Textiles between overbridge and east fort Trivandrum. POORI is the speciality item available from this Hotel and it is the only item served. Hot & Crispy POORI are served, accompanied with Potato masala curry, Green payaru curry, Chopped onions, Green chilly paste curry, Mango pickles and Pappadam. No where in India you can such a POORI and Curry items which looks very differently and smelling and tasting passing us a traditional and ethnic feel. Such a Hotel it was. Limited seats are available and you have to wait for some time.

Recently I saw some Fb post regarding this restaurant and noticed that I had never wrote a review about this. I visited this place from my school days. So it's almost 18 years relationship  No menu restaurant. We will get a plate of pooris with green gram curry, chilly curry, pappad and onions with some sweetness. Also masala tea is available.  Small hotel with less seating capacity. We will get pooris for evening time from 3pm.  I recommend I guarantee for taste
BEING A Moody Gujrati i preffer taste over evrything and saurashtra restaurant provides finger liking dishes ..!! loved its dosa ..!!
3 Fresh fluffy wheat pooris, 2 kerala papadam, mirch-besan curry, dal curry, chopped onions - all these on a thali - that is what you get in Saurashtra Hotel, better known as Gujarat Hotel. Opens around 4 in the evening, till about 9 or so. Have on plate and end with hot elaichi chai - all for Rs.50
For the residents of trivandrum...Saurastra hotel or for some Gujarathi Hotel is a unique experience...Why?? One might ask...and the answer is simple...for the kerala taste buds this a new taste. For north indians, the dishes might not be that unique or for that matter so authentic...but for keralites this a new experience...There is just poori with lentil curry, onions with a bit of sugar water sprinkled on it, pickle (it might be gooseberry pickle or mango. .. depending on factors. ..I personally like mango) and a unique chilly lentil sweet and hot curry (my preference). The hotels open only by evening and open till 8:30 -9:00 and usually theres a que mostly due to rush and lacking of seating space (Landmark hotel...so I prefer it stay like that...coz some things shouldnt change...and while you wait you can see all different kinds of people returning with satisfied smiles....children smiling because of the new experience or maybe fighting for new toys from the fancy store nearby...)Along with this you also get pappadam...Then there is the tea....I can summarise the tea only as excellence. ..(perfect if they could get the right milk) Its affordable and youll leave with your belly and hearts filled...PS If you have a hifi partner...avoid the hotel...coz if youre looking for ambiance and a candle lit dinner this is not the place...but if your looking for a different experience for yourself and your taste buds then yesss...Enjoy...
